# WezQuiz_V2
Second version of the quiz app required by Hyperion for the career program. We decided to take a completely different direction and make the entire program in backend code because we 
are not properly equipped to put together a decent full-stack web application. More updates to follow.

Instructions:
1. Copy and paste the python code into your IDE 
2. Make sure the text files are all saved in the same folder as where you paste the code or it will not be able to access the pre-written quizzes
3. Run the code
